# Examples

## Cloud Inference
[cloud_inference.py](cloud_inference.py) demonstrates the use of the Amazon Sagemaker cloud inference api.

## Generating Simulated Events
[plot_simulated_event.py](plot_simulated_event.py) demonstrates the generation of single simulated events through generating a few events and plotting them.

## Generating Simulated Datasets
[generate_simulated_dataset.py](generate_simulated_dataset.py) demonstrates the generation of simulated datasets through the generation of a simulated dataset located in `data/working/synthetic/simulated_dataset`

## Generating Masks from Wrapped Interferograms
[infer_mask.py](infer_mask.py) demonstrates the inference of masks from interferograms. This example downlaods models and plots inferred masks and presence values of a given interferogram.
